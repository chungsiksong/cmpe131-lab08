# Step 1: Specify the base image to use
FROM node:20.18-alpine
# Update base OS packages to include security fixes for the image
RUN apk update && apk upgrade --no-cache

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
# This is where our app's code will live.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Step 3: Copy package.json and package-lock.json
# Copying these first allows Docker to cache the installed dependencies.
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install production dependencies
# 'npm ci' is often faster and more reliable for CI/CD. 
# The '--only=production' flag skips developer dependencies.
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the application source code
COPY . .

# Step 6: Expose the port the app runs on
# This tells Docker which port to make available.
EXPOSE 3000

# Step 7: Define the command to run the application
# This is the command that will be executed when the container starts.
CMD [ "node", "app.js" ]
